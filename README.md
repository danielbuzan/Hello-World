# Hello-World

Why did you take this course and what are you hoping to get out of it?
   I took this course in hopes for learning computer programs/code. I also took it as I enjoyed taking the introductory course last year in grade 10. I also need the course for my SHSM diploma.
  
What games and/or applications do you think are designed very well or have interesting features you would like to learn how to implement in your own games/applications? List the apps and features
  Apples IOS interface is probably the most well designed one in my opinion. It is so simple and easy to use, while still allowing for customization. Id like to learn how to create visual output and how to allow the user to be able to alter that output to their own preference.
